                <p class="about-text">
                    I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland (RCSI), where I investigate non-coding driver mutations in breast cancer using large-scale genomic datasets including TCGA, ICGC, and ENCODE. My research focuses on identifying functional variants in regulatory elements that affect transcription factor binding and gene expression, with the goal of uncovering novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in breast cancer subtypes. I apply integrative computational approaches and machine learning to map chromatin accessibility, mutation data, and expression profiles. Prior to starting my PhD, I completed my B.Sc. in Genetics and Cell Biology at Dublin City University with First Class Honours, ranking 2nd in my cohort and earning a place on the Dean's Honours List.

                <p class="about-text">
                    My research has been recognized with multiple awards, including the Government of Ireland Postgraduate Scholarship (18% success rate), the Breakthrough Cancer Research Summer Student Scholarship, and 2nd place at the 2025 Google Ireland Hackathon, where my team developed TestBuddy, an AI-powered driving education platform. I've presented my work at conferences including the Conway Institute Research Festival, where I received perfect scores from both judges among over 100 poster submissions. I'm passionate about science communication and was awarded Best Lay Presentation at Breakthrough Cancer Research for effectively communicating complex genomic research to cancer survivors and research peers. Beyond cancer genomics, I have broad interests spanning AI applications in healthcare, cloud computing, and digital health, having built scalable multi-agent systems and gained industry experience in biopharma analytical testing.

                <p class="about-text">
                    Some of my other interests include graphic design, languages, and creative problem-solving. Before fully transitioning to bioinformatics, I ran PRODIGY Creative, a multimedia design business where I completed over 500 projects for 300+ clients worldwide. I speak English natively, French professionally, conversational Irish, and have receptive bilingualism in Yoruba. Outside the lab, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open science initiatives, and mentoring students interested in computational biology.
